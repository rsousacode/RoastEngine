ROAST ENGINE

RoastEngine is a Project that aims to implement a Vulkan Renderer for 2D and 3D purposes.
For now the initial focus is to be able to render images, textures, and geometric objects in 3D, allowing rotations using quaternions.
The long-term goal is to be able to fit other renderers such as OpenGL, DirectX and Metal in the same engine, but the main focus will be on the Vulkan implementation.
